## Legal basis

We collect and store your data for the following reasons:

- To fulfill contractual obligations with a data subject.
- To perform tasks at the request of a data subject who is in the process of
  entering into a contract with a data controller.

(For more information about these reasons, see [the explanation on Wikipedia][wikipedia-gdpr-lawful-basis])

[wikipedia-gdpr-lawful-basis]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation#Lawful_basis_for_processing

## Use and flow of the data

We use your data to do the following:

- to allow you to log in to the site. In this case your data stays in our main servers only.
- to send you an invoice, we never save your invoicing data, we delegate Stripe and Chargebee the storage and management of your data.
- as an Italian company we need to send electronic copy of all our invoices to the state. To do that we have an automated service that pulls the data from Chargebee and generates the invoices also on Fatture in Cloud. So your invoicing data will be both on Chargebee and Fatture in Cloud.
- to send you transactional emails about the service, promotional and marketing emails we use Mailchimp and Hubspot.
- on support request we ask your email address to contact you back and we share that information with Front, the service we use for customer care.
- when you fill the online forms and when you sign up we send the provided data to Pipedrive and Hubspot to improve the sale process.
- when an error occurs on the platform we automatically send some telemetry data to Rollbar to be notified about the errors and help us to resolve them. If the error happens on the CMS interface we also send the email address of the user to be able to easily get in touch to gain additional information.

## Duration of data retention

We store your data for the duration of your use of the system.

As soon as you cancel your account, your personal information is erased.

## Your rights over your personal data

We respect your right to do the following:

- request a copy of your data
- update your data
- request deletion of your data

Please contact us (at the address below) if you want to do any of the above.

## How to contact us
